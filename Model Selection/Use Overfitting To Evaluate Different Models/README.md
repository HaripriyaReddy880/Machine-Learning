In order to avoid overfitting, when any classification parameter needs to be adjusted, it is necessary to have a validation set in addition to the training and test sets.
Training Data is used to train the candidate algorithms.
Validation Data is used to compare their performances and decide which one to take.
Test Data is used to obtain the performance characteristics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity.
