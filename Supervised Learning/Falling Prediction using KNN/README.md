K-NN is a simple algorithm that can be used when you have a bunch of objects that have been classified or labeled in some way, and other similar objects that haven’t gotten classified or labeled yet, and you want a way to automatically label them.
K-NN
It is used when
you have a bunch of objects that have been classified, and
you want a way to automatically clasify similar objects that haven’t gotten classified.
Procedure of automation
Step 1: Define similarity of two objects
Step 2: Compare the similarity of a given unrated object with all the classified objects.
Step 3: Take the most similar objects and call them neighbors, who each have a “label.”
Step 4: Determine the "label" of the unrated object.
