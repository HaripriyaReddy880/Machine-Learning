Linear Regression Model : A regression is a statistical analysis assessing the association between two variables. It is used to find the relationship between two variables. To train a Linear Regression model, we need to find the value of θ. To find the value of θ that minimizes the cost function, there is a closed-form solution—in other words, a mathematical equation that gives the result directly. This is called the Normal Equation We modify the code in Linear regression using the Normal Equation.
